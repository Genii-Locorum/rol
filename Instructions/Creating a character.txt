Ensure your GM has turned on "Character Creation" mode - if so you will see input boxes for the stats - if not you will see default scores/half-scores instead

There are four areas to the character sheet
    a. Character details
    b. Characteristic scores
    c. Current Stats and Status
    d. Tab screen (please take note of the padlock icon ar the right of these tabs)

Character Details
- You can change the default portrait and name
- If the GM has activated “Allow Demi Monde” investigators in system settings you can select Investigator or Demi Monde for the character type.
- Enter an Occupation, birthplace and residence, pronouns and age.  
- Select an affluence level - the default is Average and you will need to delete this if you want to select Poor.
  This will get updated if the appropriate advantages are taken later

Characteristic scores
- Enter your Characteristic scores – the current total will show at the right hand side of the screen.  
  If the total exceeds the maximum value the whole box will turn red.  This won’t prevent you having those scores – it is just a warning.  
- The maximum total score, max/min individual values and whether individual values are rounded to the nearest 10 are set in system settings
- If you enter a very low or very high score (above whatever the GM has set as the maximum/minimum) the characteristic will automatically 
  update to fit within the acceptable range
- Your stats will also automatically round to the nearest mutliple of 10 unless the GM has set the game to allow single points
- In both cases the total score will also update

Current Stats and Status
- Don’t worry about Luck at this stage – we’ll cover that shortly
- If you are an “Investigator” you will see “Magic Points” – the first number is your current MP and the second your Maximum.  
  Your Max MP will update automatically.  If you hover your mouse over “Magic Points” the title will glow red.  
  Double click on this to reset your current MP to full.  Alternatively, you can manually enter them.
- Damage should be set to zero at this stage.  We will cover the various icons and changing damage later.
- You can enter your base movement rate here.  The value will depend on whether you have the relevant advantages or have set the appropriate advanced rule in system settings
- The Effects box will display the icons for the relevant advantages your character has (they are also listed on the traits tab).
- Hyper Thaumaturgical Degradation (HTD) will be covered later.
- The Reset Luck box is used to roll your starting luck.  Click on the box to roll the appropriate score (or match the appropriate score for Demi Mond investigators).  
  This will only work once (the GM can reset this if needed).

Tab Screen
- At the top of this section is a list of tabs (Skills, Magic etc).  Clicking on the tab will change the information displayed in the section below.
- Skills – add the appropriate skills to the character by dragging them from  the main “Items” tab.  You will get an error message flash up on screen 
  if you try to add the magic skill before adding the relevant magic advantage.  
- You can drag whole folders of skills across (but it will only include skills that are direct children of the folder)
- If you want to delete a skill from the character sheet toggle the padlock icon to unlocked and you should now see trashcan icons by the skill
  Simply click on the trashcan to remove the skill.
- The skills will automatically appear under the Common/Expert/Weapons heading depending on what you set for the skill.
- Clicking on the “i” icon will let you see more detail about the skill and edit the base chance if the character sheet is unlocked.

- Magic – this follows the same approach to skills, except that spells are grouped by Spell Order.
- If you master a spell click on the “i” icon and toggle the “Mastered” box to on.  This will put a green certificate icon by the spell name.
- There may be a number to the right of the spell name - this is the base damage the spell causes
- As with skills you will get an error message flash up if you try to add a spell that you don’t have the pre-requisites for or if you don’t meet the rules on numbers of spells.

- Traits – the advantages follow the same approach as skills.  Disadvantages are shown with a red skull.
- You can add contacts by clicking on the “+Add Contact”.  Simply add the name of the contact.  You can click on the “i” icon to add a short description and to toggle the status
  of the relationship.  This will then add a green smiley face or a red frown to the contact’s name depending on t he status
- If you have taken the magical advantage, you will can enter your Signare.
- Demi-Monde investigators can enter their Thematic Power.

- Equipment – you can add weapons, armour and equipment like skills
- For weapons you can click on the “i” icon and if the character sheet is unlocked you can toggle “Signature” on for a signature weapon if you have the appropriate advantage.  
  This will add a green star next to the weapon.  
- A green cross hair by the weapon means it is an automatic weapon whereas a red cross hair means it’s a semi automatic weapon.
- The number to the right of the weapon name is the base damage the weapon causes
- General equipment can also be added directly by clicking on the “+Add Item” button

- Biography – you can enter details of your backstory here.

- Development – this holds details of your development points and can only be changed during the development phase.  
  As you spend Development points change the “Spent” amount and update the “Development Point Spend History” to record what you spent the points on.

Don't forget to lock your character sheet when you are finished

NPCs are created in a very similar fashion but are on a more condensed character sheet.
