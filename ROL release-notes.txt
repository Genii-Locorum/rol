V8
- Character and NPC sheets will now be coloured green for Demi Monde.  Everything else remains blue.
- Moved hp.max and armour.natural for permanent stats to derived stats to remove an _id error on creating actor

V7 27/05/2023
- checked for compatability with Foundry V11
- added check to stop duplicate skills, spells or advantages being added to the character sheet

V6 11/04/2023
-The three instructions documents moved to a Journal compendium to make them visible in game
-Checks rolls code refactored to enable item macros
-Item macro functionality added - drag item to the hotbar - you can trigger rolls from there for spells, skills, or weapons (otherwise display the equipment sheet)  
-Tweak to natural armour to remove the armour points if the advantage is removed
-Bonus/Penalty dice selector on difficulty rolls is now -1 to +1, unless it's for attacks (weapons or spells) in which case it remains at -2 to +2.  The underlying 
functionality hasn't changed (max one bonus/penalty dice, but with the extra one carried over to damage rolls) - it is just a cosmetic change
-Actor and Item sheets redesigned to incorporate a bit more colour, make the font a bit larger and to fix some bugs
-Context menus added to spells, skills etc - at this stage just edit and delete (icons removed in the sheet redesign) - more functionality may follow
